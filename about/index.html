      <div class="page-content"><p><strong>I am an attorney in Portland, Oregon, currently developing web and software based solutions to promote access to justice.</strong></p>

<p>I believe in trying to leave everyone better off than they were found.</p>

<p>I have <a href="/resume/">practiced law</a> for more than 10 years in both the non-profit and private sectors, and maintain a social justice-minded and communally responsible approach to the law.</p>

<p>In law school, I studied abroad twice. First at the University of Amsterdam, where I studied Family, Health, and Reproductive Law, and second at the University of Technology in  Sydney, where I studied International Civil Rights and Business Law.</p>

<p>I graduated from Lewis and Clark Law School in 2010, and from UC San Diego in 2007, where I earned a B.S. in Behavioral Psychology.</p>

<p>I have a passion for gaming in all forms, both digital and physical. Tabletop games and video games are my regular hobbies. I am also an aspiring Dungeon Master.</p>

<p>This site also features <a href="/projects/">my projects</a> and <a href="/blog/">my writing</a>.</p>
