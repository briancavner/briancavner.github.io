<div class="page-title">Face Mask Mandate Facing Facial Challenge in Florida</div>
<div class="post-content"><p>The United States’ reputation for rampant lawsuits is due, in part, to our legal philosophy that everyone should have their colloquial “day in court”. Courthouse staff do not assess the merits of a claim; if a person is able to file their paperwork correctly and pay the court’s waivable filing fee, they may proceed with a lawsuit. Frivilous suits that are filed “pro se” — that is, without a lawyer — are easy to find as a result, but tend not to be very interesting unless you also enjoy reading the Facebook rants of the unstable.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6962061/Lawsuit-against-Palm-Beach-County-mask-mandate.pdf">this particular lawsuit</a> [PDF] challenging the constitutionality of Florida’s COVID-related mask ordinance was filed by not one, but four lawyers, and only one of them believes that Bill Gates is genetically engineering an army of genocidal mosquitos<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. The 152-paragraph complaint takes the approach of throwing every imaginable legal theory at a problem in the hopes that one sticks. This gives some arguments that go beyond zealous advocacy and into the realm of silliness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Defendant’s unlawful Mask Mandate is also obviously unconstitutional because it violates the freedom of speech of millions of Palm Beach County residents and visitors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before looking at the merits, I find it necessary for an aside about words like “obviously”. As a writing instructor of mine once said, if your point is truly “obvious”, you’re wasting your time making it, because everyone already agrees. If everyone doesn’t already agree, then your point isn’t “obvious”, and it’s meaningless to claim that it is.</p>

<p>Rhetoric like that isn’t useful in persuading people who disagree; it’s only useful in getting people who already agree with you to nod their heads along. This stylistic device is used throughout.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is without doubt that facial coverings severely impinge on speaking and not only impairs speech, but also discourages people from speaking or communicating with others due to difficulties such as inability to hear a muffled voice, or difficulties breathing, as many experience while being forced to wear suffocating medical devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is certainly novel to consider wearing a mask to be a prior restraint on speech, even putting aside the fact that translucent masks and face shields exist — or perhaps translucent “suffocating medical devices” exist. As millions of non-mute medical practitioners can attest, wearing a mask is not an unsurmountable impairment on speech. If the “inability to hear a muffled voice” truly triggered a First Amendment concern, I wonder why the Plaintiffs have not yet sued any publicly funded library that tells its patrons to whisper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Defendant’s unconstitutional Mask Mandate recklessly discriminates against thousands of facial expressions which do not fall within arbitrary and inexplicable exceptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Facial expressions can unquestionably be considered speech for First Amendment purposes, and it’s no more constitutional for a police officer to arrest someone for sticking their tongue out at them than for chanting a political slogan. But “discriminates” is not the magic word the Plaintiffs seem to believe it is. The mask mandate as it might apply to expressive communication is content-neutral, meaning it applies to all forms of expression regardless of the substance of the expression. This is important constitutionally because it affects the level of scrutiny the court must apply when analyzing the law. A content-neutral law is constitutional if it is in furtherence of a substantial government interest unrelated to the supression of speech<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Here, it would be the state’s interest in slowing the spread of coronavirus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A mask is in and of itself a form of speech. By forcing countless individuals, including the Plaintiffs to wear a mask or muzzle, Defendant Palm Beach County has not protected anyone from harm or disease, but rather unjustly and unlawfully forced a warped and potentially harmful form of speech upon millions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Masks have transitioned now from being “suffocating medical devices” to being “muzzles”, a performance of rhetorical dishonesty worthy of Saul Goodman.</p>

<p>This argument recalls similar ones made by parade organizers. Courts have long upheld the idea that parades may exclude groups whose messages they believe conflict with their own. Mere association can itself be expressive, and refusing to associate with someone — or refusing to invite someone to your parade, or refusing to wear a mask — can also be expressive.</p>

<p>But in the context of a mask mandate that applies to everyone generally, it seems unreasonable to argue that compliance with the law carries an expressive element of also endorsing it. I doubt the Plaintiffs would argue similarly that laws requiring seatbelts unconstitutionally force expression.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Defendant’s Mask Mandate’s infringement upon freedom of speech is so egregious that it infringes upon childhood development and the learning of speech. Children, as well as adults, need to see mouths moving and facial expressions to develop speech and learn to communicate properly as living, breathing human beings have done for countless generations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A citation is needed, but not provided. This argument is baseless without a study to suggest that childhood speech development is inhibited by a short-term and periodic inability to see a mouth move.</p>

<p>In the end, whether the lawsuit succeeds or fails doesn’t actually matter. No state has yet had the resolve to pass and enforce a mask mandate with teeth. All have carved exceptions designed to let bad faith actors flout the law, which has resulted in the United States leading the world in Coronavirus infections and deaths at a rate nearly double the next most affected nation, and over quadruple the third most<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. This is born from the perverted idea that wearing a mask is a political decision rather than a scientific or medical one. That mindset is clear from a single line in the suit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It also jeopardizes the spirit of the sturdy and self-reliant philosophy of individualism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is time for our leaders to stop harming the public at large to cater to those few who still cling to the sinking ship of individualism.</p>
